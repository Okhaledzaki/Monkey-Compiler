This is a python implementation of thorsten ball's two books, the first one is a simple interpreter with Pratt parser and the second one he does bytecode, code generation, and virtual machines and bunch of other stuff ***didn't read it yet***. His writing is clean, although the Dolang code could be much better and cleaner, and there are fairly large number of hacks, but overall the books are amazing.

This repository for the purpose of me studying, so bad code, no tests, and gluing things to get the main function rolling. I just want to finish these two books asap to get started in the dragons book ... that would be a great repo; dragons in python.

You can run the REPL from main.py ---> It is now just emits the tokens so it is more RTPL ... T for tokenize.
