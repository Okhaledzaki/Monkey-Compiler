**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**


This is ```Python``` implementation for the amazing books on interpreters and compilers by Thorsten Ball. The book code is written in ```golang```, so to retain the information in the book more, I decided to do it in ```Python``` as it is very flexible and malleable.
</br></br>The code in this repository follows the same sequence and structure as in the book as much as it is possible to do so, so you can use it instead of the code provided with the book and brush up on your ```Python``` skills.
</br></br?You can run the REPL from main.py ---> It is now just emitting the tokens so it is more RTPL ... T for tokenize.</br></br>
