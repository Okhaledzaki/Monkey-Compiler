This is python implementation of thorsten ball's two books, the first one is a simple interpreter with Pratt parser and the second one he does bytecode and stuff *didn't read it yet*. His writing is clean, although the golang code could be better and cleaner, and there are fairly large number of hacks, but overall the books are amazing.

You can run the REPL from main.py.
